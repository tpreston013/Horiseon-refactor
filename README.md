# Horiseon-refactor

This is an application for a marketing agency, which has been updated to meet accessibility standards with updated image alt descriptions. 

Furthermore, the markup and style sheet has been refactored to logically divide each section of the application. Repetitive sections are condensed, tags are better defined, and the overall look has been cleaned up.
